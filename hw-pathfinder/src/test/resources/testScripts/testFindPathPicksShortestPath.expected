# Tests that path finding applies Dijkstra's algorithm properly
# by choosing the minimum-cost path of two paths

created graph g

added node p1 to g
added node p2 to g
added node p3 to g

added edge 1.000 from p1 to p2 in g
added edge 1.000 from p2 to p3 in g
added edge 1.000 from p1 to p3 in g

path from p1 to p3:
p1 to p3 with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
