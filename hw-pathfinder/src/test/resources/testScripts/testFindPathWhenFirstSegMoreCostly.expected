# Tests that path finding applies Dijkstra's algorithm properly
# by finding the overall shortest path, even when the first segment
# is more costly

created graph g

added node p1 to g
added node p2 to g
added node p3 to g
added node p4 to g

added edge 1.000 from p1 to p2 in g
added edge 3.000 from p2 to p4 in g
added edge 2.000 from p1 to p3 in g
added edge 1.000 from p3 to p4 in g

path from p1 to p4:
p1 to p3 with weight 2.000
p3 to p4 with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
