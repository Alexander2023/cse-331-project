# Tests that path finding applies Dijkstra's algorithm properly when
# encountering multiple edges of different costs between pairs of nodes

created graph g

added node p1 to g
added node p2 to g
added node p3 to g

added edge 1.000 from p1 to p2 in g
added edge 2.000 from p1 to p2 in g
added edge 1.000 from p2 to p3 in g
added edge 2.000 from p2 to p3 in g

path from p1 to p3:
p1 to p2 with weight 1.000
p2 to p3 with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
