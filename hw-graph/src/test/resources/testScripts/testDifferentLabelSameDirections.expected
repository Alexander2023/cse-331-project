# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add two edges with different labels in same direction
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the children of the nodes
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
