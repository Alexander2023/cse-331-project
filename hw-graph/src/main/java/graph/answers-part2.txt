## CSE 331 hw-graph Part 2 Questions

submission. You may leave it blank for hw-graph-part1.

## Part 1

A few examples of possible Graph representations:

    A: A collection of nodes and a collection of edges.
    B: An adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
    C: An adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of nodes, whether there 
       is a link from A to B, and how many.

1. In two or three sentences, explain an advantage and a disadvantage of each of the
representations listed above (for example, in terms of runtime complexity, space
complexity, or ease of implementation).

Rep A has the advantage of ease of implementation but the disadvantage of there being no association
between edges of a given node.

Rep B has the advantage of having associations of edges of a given node but the disadvantage
of O(|V|) time complexity for checking whether two vertices are adjacent.

Rep C has the advantage of O(1) time complexity for checking whether two vertices are adjacent
but the disadvantage of difficulty of implementation.

2. In two to three sentences, describe the representation you chose and explain why you
chose it. If you chose to use a different representation than one of the three we described
above, be sure to list its advantages and disadvantages, too.

I chose rep B because it has O(1) time complexity for adding nodes and edges to the graph. Also
since it will allow quick lookups for child nodes and outgoing edges associated with a node.

    (Please keep your answers brief and to-the-point.)

1. Describe any new tests you added and why you added them, or why you feel that your original
tests alone are sufficient.




2. Did you make any changes to your specifications as you were implementing your Graph? (yes/no)
If yes, describe your changes and why you made them.
