# Tests that BFS chooses the lexicographically least path when two paths of same length

created graph g

added node c1 to g
added node c2 to g
added node c3 to g
added node c4 to g

added edge b1 from c1 to c2 in g
added edge b2 from c2 to c4 in g
added edge b3 from c1 to c3 in g
added edge b4 from c3 to c4 in g

path from c1 to c4:
c1 to c2 via b1
c2 to c4 via b2
